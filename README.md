## `Mexico Toy Sales`
Sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.

### Some general questions that can be answered using this dashboard:
-Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
-Can you find any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
-Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
-How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?
